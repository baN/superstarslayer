Astronaut
States:
  - On Planet:
    TODO: Figure how to use colliders to allow astronaut to land on the surface of the planet.

  - Off planet:
  TODO: User input on mouse click to trigger jumping/traversing to another planet(target).

new features I've implemented are:
1: imploda will switch to the hurt sprite when she collides with a particle. I had to create a custom wait function to allow the player to see she died and will respawn.
2: imploda will collect all the swords and switch to the sword version sprite
3: Added the esc button when playing on builds to exit the application
4: Added the sword collection pieces (if she gets hit, it will respawn the pieces back to its original position)
